# About
The electronics within the final Cupcake24 build will be a modernised variant of the original Gen3 electronics, with the following changes made from the original files:

- PCB & Schematics ported to KiCAD 8.0
  - Reorganisation of Schematic to fit into one small page
  - Symbol locations adjusted to make values easier to read
  - Where possible, Schematic symbols swapped for KiCAD equivalents
  - Where possible, PCB footprints swapped for KiCAD equivalents
- PCB outline re-drawn and rounded-off
- PCB modified to run ground through the groundplane, rather than individual traces
- All traces, text, vias ect adjusted to be entirely metric (I.E: 0.3048mm traces (12mill) changed to 0.3mm traces)
- Silkscreen entirely overhauled, with information more clearly marked, text relocated & re-sized for improved readability, and information about Cupcake24 in an out-of-sight place (Generally, the rear of the PCB, or under a large component such as the SD reader)
- Some minor fixes to some traces not being run entirely in straight lines
